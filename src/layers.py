            Layer, which takes a tf.Tensor as input and returns a tf.Tensor as output. It will be called with each of
            the integers in 'hidden_blocks' as the 'size' argument, and 'activation' as the 'activation' argument.
        change_size: A function of the same form as make_block. Will be called whenever reshaping is necessary to
            perform the addition part of a ResNet. (Because the size of the output of the previous block is not the same
            size as the input to the block.) Unused in reshape='never'.
        hidden_blocks: A nested structure of tuples and integers, defining the sizes of the layers of the ResNet. If the
            entry of the tuple is an integer, then it corresponds to a layer of that size being created (via the
            make_block function). If the entry is a tuple then residual_layers is called recursively on the tuple, and
            the result added on in the manner of ResNets. i.e. setting hidden_blocks=(4, (3, 3)) would
            generate the following structure, with 'a' denoting the argument 'activation':

                                        --> make_block(3, a) -> make_block(3, a) --\

            input -> make_block(4, a) -------------> change_size(3, a) ----------> add -> output

        reshape: One of 'always', 'necessary' or 'never'. If it is 'always' then change_size will always be called
            during the 'identity' part of the ResNet. If it is 'necessary' then it will be called only when necessary
            to perform the addition. If it is 'never' then change_size will not be used, and an Exception raised if the
            sizes do not allow addition.
        activation: The activation function to use throughout; passed as an argument to make_block and change_size.

    Returns:
        A tf.Tensor that is the output of the set of residual blocks.
