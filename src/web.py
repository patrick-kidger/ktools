class Knot:
    """Represents the vertex of a graph. Here we instead call them Knots in webs, however, to avoid confusion with the
    usual TensorFlow meaning of 'Graph'.

    Must have a layer attached to it, and it may be connected to other knots, which will be treated as its inputs.
    Calling make() on a Knot will then call its layer on the layers of inputs Knots (recursively).

    Whilst Keras does have Nodes which keeps track of something similar, they don't have quite the flexibility that
    we're after to make this work.

    The idea is that this is a wrapper around Keras layers, which may be called in exactly the same manner as Keras'
    functional API. Applying these calls to the Keras layers is handed in the Knot.make method; this allows for
    substituting some layers for other layers and then rebuilding easily. In particular the Knot.model method converts
    the web of Knots into a Keras Model.

    Note that all errors from trying to assemble the layers - e.g. incorrect shapes or cyclic webs - will only be
    noticed when actually assembling, via either Knot.make or Knot.model.

    Example:
        input = Knot(keras.layers.Input(shape=(2,)))
        x = Knot(keras.layers.Dense(1024))(input)  # calling returns the Knot instance wrapping the Dense layer.
        y = Knot(keras.layers.Dense(512))(input)
        c = Knot(keras.layers.Concatenate())([x, y])
        z = Knot(keras.layers.Dense(1024))(c)
        keras_model = z.model()
        ...
        # Now we want to replace the dense layer of size 512 with something bigger:
        y.set_layer(keras.layers.Dense(1024))
        keras_model_2 = z.model()

    Example:
        input = Knot(keras.layers.Input(shape=(2,)))
        x = Knot(keras.layers.Dense(1024))(input)
        y = Knot(keras.layers.Dense(1024))(x)
        z = Knot(keras.layers.Dense(1024))(y)
        tensorflow_tensor = z.make()
        ...
        # Now we want to replace the Knot y with some other Knot entirely. (In this simple example this is essentially
        # equivalent to just doing y.set_layer(keras.layers.Dense(2048)), as above.)
        w = Knot(keras.layers.Dense(2048))
        y.replace(w)  # y is no longer attached to anything; x and z now connect to w instead.
        tensorflow_tensor_2 = z.make()
        ...
        # Now we want to replace the Knot w with a web of two Knots, a and b:
        a = Knot(keras.layers.Dense(512))
        b = Knot(keras.layers.Dense(512))(a)
        w.replace_multi(input_knots=a, output_knots=b)  # w is no longer attached to anything

            'pydot', and attempt to display it in ImageMagick, by calling the 'display' command. Using 'basic' will
            resort to using the default 'draw' function of NetworkX; this is most likely to work on all platforms, but
            will not have the nice hierarchical layout; the picture tends to be cleaner though.
        returnval: Whether or not to return something. Defaults to False (to avoid cluttering up the REPL when used
            there.)

    Returns:
        If :returnval: is True, and any of the formats other than 'basic' are used, then it will return a bytes string
        representing the image that is displayed.
